# Genhack_competition

## Submission

In general,

- Function G (the model)
- The associated trained parameters theta
- The sampled Z (csv file with 410 or 408 rows and your chosen dimension of Z)
    - Also, it must be sampled from a standard Gaussian
- The outputs (csv file with 410 or 408 rows and 4 columns)


The zipped folder should include,

Along with the simulated data in a .csv file of syntax ``<guild-name>number_submission.csv``, you will also submit:

- Simulated data ``generated_samples.csv``
- The noise values with which you simulated the data ``noise.csv``
- The python code of the inference
    - ``main.py`` file
    - ``requirements.txt`` (all dependencies)
- paramaters of the model
